# 📊 End-to-End Data Analysis Project

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, starting from loading an Excel dataset into Python to delivering insights through SQL analysis, a Power BI dashboard, and a final presentation.
The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize data in a way that supports data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📁 Dataset

* **Format:** Excel (`.xlsx`)
* **Type:** Structured tabular data
* **Source:** Provided dataset for analysis
* **Loaded Using:** Python (Pandas)

The dataset contains multiple features used for exploratory analysis, cleaning, SQL querying, and visualization.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **MySQL** (Data storage & SQL querying)
* **Power BI** (Dashboard & visualization)
* **Gamma AI** (Report & presentation creation)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Git & GitHub**
